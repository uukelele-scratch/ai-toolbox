# ScratchGPT and Stable Diffusion based AI Project
[AI Toolbox](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1088420865/)

We use huggingface's inference API with [Stable Diffusion 3.5](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3.5-large) to generate our images.
Then, we convert them into a format Scratch can read.
Finally, we send them over to the project.
